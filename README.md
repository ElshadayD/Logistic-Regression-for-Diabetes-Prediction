# Logistic Regression for Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of logistic regression for diabetes prediction using the scikit-learn library. The logistic regression model is trained on the diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Introduction

Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It models the relationship between a set of features and a binary target variable by estimating the probabilities of the target variable being in each class.

In this project, logistic regression is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health-related features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age.
